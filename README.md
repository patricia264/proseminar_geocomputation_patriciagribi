## Summary

This research project aims to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to 2100. 
In a first step, data used for global mean CO2 concentration and 
temperature records will be identified and described. The sources, 
methodologies and associated challenges will be discussed. In a further 
step the time series will be completed by modelling missing data and analyzed. 
The analysis will focus on potential historical trends (e.g. since the 
industrial revolution) and make comparisons between different latitudes.
The final step will be to model and predict different future scenarios. This 
by considering different temperature and CO2 values and other potentially influencing
variables.


## Background and Motivation

Why is your project important? What is known and unknown?

Why important: current climate debate, climate change, future scenarios,

this is known: glacial and interglacial periods, co2 amount in the
atmosphere varies, in the last century there has been a strong increase
in co2 levels due to anthropogenic activities, the amount of co2 in the
atmosphere correlates with the temperature -- the average global
temperature is rising.

this is unkown: overall uncertainty of paleo-based estimates of climate
sensitivity


## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to the year 2100. 
From this basis the following questions should be answered: 
Which CO2 and temperature scenario is most likely to occur? And on what grounds?


## Implementation

To model the data and complete different future scenarios the supervised
machine learning method will be used, introduced in the course AGDS I. 


## Timeline

Session 9 (15.11.) : Data Analysis 
Session 10 (22.11) : Data Analysis 
Session 11 (29.11) : Writing report, Interpretation and Conclusion
Session 12 (06.12) : Make corrections, layout
Session 13 (13.12) : Create Presentation, Finish report
Session 14 (20.12) : Presentation, Report Submission


## Risks and contingency

Expected risks in this project include dealing with incomplete data. This
issue will be adressed by modelling missing data.

The data will come in different formats, layouts and with probably NA values and 
probably also more variables than needed. The challenges ahead involves the entire
data wrangling and data cleaning process, which is necessary to ensure that the data 
is tidy by the end of the process. 

Furthermore, it'll be difficult to determine how deeply to analyze the data to make
meaningful conclusions and share interesting findings. To target this issue, it'll
be important to maintain a constant dialogue with the tutors and to ask questions.


## Impact

How will your results answer unknowns? What are the expected scientific
and societal impacts? - Expected scientific impact(s): e.g. contributing
to specific scientific advances, across and within disciplines,
reinforcing research infrastructures (databases, equipment, and
instruments) - Expected societal impact(s): e.g. improving policies and
decision-making, providing guidance for sustainable management, raising
consumer awareness. Only include such impacts where your project would
make a direct contribution.
