## Summary

This research project aims to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to 2100. 
In a first step, data used for global mean CO2 concentration and 
temperature records will be identified and described. The sources, 
methodologies and associated challenges will be discussed. In a further 
step the time series will be completed by modelling missing data and analyzed. 
The analysis will focus on potential historical trends (e.g. since the 
industrial revolution) and make comparisons between different latitudes.
The final step will be to model and predict different future scenarios. This 
by considering different temperature and CO2 values and other potentially influencing
variables.


## Background and Motivation

The importance of my research project lies in its relevance to the ongoing and intensifying 
debate surrounding climate change. As we approach the limits set by the Paris Agreement, 
understanding the likely scenarios that we are heading toward becomes increasingly crucial.

The fluctuations between glacial and interglacial periods, the varying levels of CO2 in the 
atmosphere, and the significant recent increase in CO2 concentrations resulting from 
anthropogenic activities are all well-established facts among the big majority of scientists 
[Farah 2019, S.321ff].

The overall uncertainty surrounding paleo-based estimates of climate sensitivity remains a 
topic of uncertainty and ongoing research in the field of climate science 
[Friedrich u. Timmermann 2019, S.1].


## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to the year 2100. 
From this basis the following questions should be answered: 
Which CO2 and temperature scenario is most likely to occur? And on what grounds?


## Implementation

To model the data and complete different future scenarios the supervised
machine learning method will be used, introduced in the course AGDS I. 


## Timeline

Session 6 (25.10.) : Final proposal and data research and loading in R 

Session 7 (01.11.) : Tidy data (including modelling missing values)

Session 8 (08.11.) : Visualization and description of the data 

Session 9 (15.11.) : Data analysis 

Session 10 (22.11) : Modelling different future scenarios of CO2 and temperature with the supervised machine learning algorithm

Session 11 (29.11) : Writing obtained results, interesting aspects of the analysis, interpretation and conclusion

Session 12 (06.12) : Make corrections, check layout and citations

Session 13 (13.12) : Create presentation, finish report

Session 14 (20.12) : Presentation, report submission


## Risks and contingency

Expected risks in this project include dealing with incomplete data. This
issue will be adressed by modelling missing data.

The data will come in different formats, layouts and with probably NA values and 
probably also more variables than needed. The challenges ahead involves the entire
data wrangling and data cleaning process, which is necessary to ensure that the data 
is tidy by the end of the process. 

Furthermore, it'll be difficult to determine how deeply to analyze the data to make
meaningful conclusions and share interesting findings. To target this issue, it'll
be important to maintain a constant dialogue with the tutors and to ask questions.


## Impact

My research project aims to contribute to our understanding of the relationship
between CO2 levels and temperature changes on Earth and their impact on climate
change and hence on our lives.

In my local community, I hope to raise awareness about the issue of climate change 
to make people more concerned about this topic and may change some opinions about it.
