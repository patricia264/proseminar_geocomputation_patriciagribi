# Summary

This research project aims to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to 2100. 
In a first step, data used for global mean CO2 concentration and 
temperature records will be identified and described. The sources, 
methodologies and associated challenges will be discussed. In a further 
step the time series will be completed by modelling missing data and analyzed. 
The analysis will focus on potential historical trends (e.g. since the 
industrial revolution) and make comparisons between different latitudes.
The final step will be to model and predict different future scenarios. This 
by considering different temperature and CO2 values and other potentially influencing
variables.


# Background and Motivation

Why is your project important? What is known and unknown?

Why important: current climate debate, climate change, future scenarios,

this is known: glacial and interglacial periods, co2 amount in the
atmosphere varies, in the last century there has been a strong increase
in co2 levels due to anthropogenic activities, the amount of co2 in the
atmosphere correlates with the temperature -- the average global
temperature is rising.

this is unkown: overall uncertainty of paleo-based estimates of climate
sensitivity


# Objective

The primary goal of this project is to reconstruct a time series of global mean
CO2 and temperature data, from the Pleistocene to the year 2100. 
From this basis the following questions should be answered: 
Which CO2 and temperature scenario is most likely to occur? And on what grounds?


# Implementation

What approach will you take to achieve the goal in terms of data and
methods?

-look at agds and chatgpt

# Risks and contingency

What risks and challenges do you expect and what will you do to address
them?

Expected risks: incomplete data, the whole data wrangling and data
cleaning process to have tidy data in the end, as the data come from
different sources, with diff. variables, layouts...,

challenges: to know how much to go deep with my analyses, to actually
find out what exactly to do

# Impact

How will your results answer unknowns? What are the expected scientific
and societal impacts? - Expected scientific impact(s): e.g. contributing
to specific scientific advances, across and within disciplines,
reinforcing research infrastructures (databases, equipment, and
instruments) - Expected societal impact(s): e.g. improving policies and
decision-making, providing guidance for sustainable management, raising
consumer awareness. Only include such impacts where your project would
make a direct contribution.
