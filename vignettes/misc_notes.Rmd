    Our uncertainty analysis reveals further that the lack of robust
    reconstructions of glacial aerosol forcing is a key contributor to
    the overall uncertainty of paleo-based estimates of climate
    sensitivity.The global-mean temperature reconstruction is typically
    based on an average of local ocean and/or land temperatures derived
    from different paleo-proxies. The accuracy of these
    "paleothermometers" is uncertain. reconstructions very difficult
    because proxies can be local or influenced by other parameters,
    models on the other hand cannot take into consideration the earth
    system as a whole and complexity is therefore largely restricted
    (letzter Abschnitt introduction).

radiative forcing: change in energy balance in the Earth's atmosphere
due to various factors that influence the Earth's climate. It quantifies
the impact of different drivers on the Earth's energy budget,
specifically in terms of the incoming and outgoing energy fluxes.primary
factors, that can cause radiative forcing: greenhouse gases, aerosols,
land use changes, solar variability, stratospheric water vapor

SST: sea surface temperature

-   Identifying Signatures of Natural Climate Variability in Time Series
    of Global-Mean Surface Temperature:distinction between anthropogenic
    influences and natural variability of the climate (vulcanic
    eruptions, el ni√±o, marine air masses over high-latitude continents
    in winter)

-   Measuring Global Warming: very nice figures and well explained, FTS
    model functional time series model, obtain forecasts for next twenty
    years

"temperature anomalies": differences btw. observed temp reading and the
long-term average temp for each location and time

# Data Exploration

Explore the selected datasets to get a sense of the data's structure,
variables, and quality. Check for any missing or erroneous data that may
need to be cleaned.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning and transforming it as needed.
This may include handling missing values, standardizing units, and
merging datasets if multiple data sources are used.

# Data Analysis and Visualization

Apply statistical and data visualization techniques to analyze the data.
Use appropriate tools and libraries (e.g., Python with libraries like
pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) to create visualizations that reveal
patterns, relationships, trends, or differences.

# Hypothesis Testing (if applicable):

If your research question involves hypothesis testing, perform the
necessary statistical tests to validate or reject your hypotheses.

# Interpretation and Conclusion:

Interpret the results of your analysis in the context of your research
question. Discuss the implications and significance of your findings.
Address what is known and what remains unknown in the field.
